## General

#### What is the current status of the game?

Prosperous Universe is currently in Early Access. The goals of Early Access are to build a community early, integrate player feedback and help fund the game's development until the full release.

#### What comes after Early Access?

The next big steps will be ultimately preparing the game for the full launch (TBA). The single game world will be reset multiple times during Early Access and finally become persistent upon full launch.

#### Is Prosperous Universe a free-2-play game?

The game can be played for free! However, licensees playing for free have to deal with a few restrictions on what their companies can do. Upgrading to PRO is possible at any time by selecting a subscription plan (starting at 8â‚¬). Support tier packages are also available that give players in-game perks and PrUn merchandise. This crowdfunding-like system allows early adopters to help fund development and get some great perks in return.

#### Why a browser-based game in 2021?

We think that the browser is a very capable gaming platform, available on pretty much every computer and every system in the world. It's the perfect match for the kind of play style we have in mind, allowing people to play from their office or while doing something else without having to download, install and run client software.

#### Can Prosperous Universe be played on mobile?

A mobile version of Prosperous Universe is coming soon, please stay tuned for updates.

#### Will the game be available on Steam / the Apple App Store / my favorite platform?

First and foremost, Properous Universe is a browser-based game. While we do have plans to provide a client software that could be offered on platforms like Steam or the Apple App Store, this is a low priority for us right now.
