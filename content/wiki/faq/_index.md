## General

#### What is the current status of the game?

Prosperous Universe is currently in Early Access. The goals of Early Access are to build a community early, integrate player feedback and help fund the game's development until the full release.

#### What comes after Early Access?

The next big steps will be ultimately preparing the game for the full launch (TBA). The single game world will be reset multiple times during Early Access and finally become persistent upon full launch.

#### Is Prosperous Universe a free-2-play game?

The game can be played for free! However, licensees playing for free have to deal with a few restrictions on what their companies can do. Upgrading to PRO is possible at any time by selecting a subscription plan (starting at 8â‚¬). Support tier packages are also available that give players in-game perks and PrUn merchandise. This crowdfunding-like system allows early adopters to help fund development and get some great perks in return.

#### Why a browser-based game in 2021?

We think that the browser is a very capable gaming platform, available on pretty much every computer and every system in the world. It's the perfect match for the kind of play style we have in mind, allowing people to play from their office or while doing something else without having to download, install and run client software.

#### Can Prosperous Universe be played on mobile?

A mobile version of Prosperous Universe is coming soon, please stay tuned for updates.

#### Will the game be available on Steam / the Apple App Store / my favorite platform?

First and foremost, Prosperous Universe is a browser-based game. While we do have plans to provide a client software that could be offered on platforms like Steam or the Apple App Store, this is a low priority for us right now.

#### Can I change my username?

Unfortunately not. However, you can change your company name using COLIQ.

#### When will this universe be reset?

Currently, there are no set dates for when this universe will reset. The universe for First Access (last universe) lasted approximately 2 years.

#### What's the difference between PRO/Basic/Trial?

You can find in-depth information [here](../pro-license).

#### Is this game P2W (Pay-To-Win)?

No. While there are restrictions in place when you don't have PRO or Basic, there are only _cosmetic_ benefits to purchasing higher support tiers. For example, purchasing the universe support tier gains you no gameplay advantage of that of someone that simply purchases a month of PRO.

#### Are PRO subscriptions recurring?

No. There are no recurring payments.


## Gameplay

#### I forgot which starter package I picked, how can I look it up?

The **HELP** command contains a section labeled "Building Recommendations" which displays your starter package.

#### How do I start over?

The **COLIQ** command.

1. Click **NEW BFR** in the bottom-left corner of APEX.
2. Type **COLIQ** into the newly spawned buffer and hit enter.
3. Follow the instructions.
4. Refresh the browser tab containing APEX.

#### How often can I COLIQ?

The cooldown timers for COLIQ are:
- First: 0 days
- Second: 3 days
- Third: 21 days
- Subsequent: 60 days

#### I'm going to be away from the game for some time. How are inactive accounts handled?

- Paying accounts will not be removed at all
- Accounts less than 7 days old will be notified after 3 days of inactivity and deleted 5 days afterwards
- Accounts less than 14 days old will be notified after 14 days of inactivity and deleted 7 days afterwards
- Accounts more than 14 days old will be notified after 31 days of inactivity and deleted 21 days afterwards

Logging in will reset the timers from above.

#### I accidentally deleted some tiles. Can I reset the default screen?

Not currently. That being said, you should become familiar with the APEX interface and modify it to fit your needs as _any_ buffer can be made into a tile.

#### People are using many acronyms. How can I find out what they are talking about?

Open either a **MAT** (material) or **BUI** (building) buffer to the acronym.

- **MAT XXX**
- **BUI YYY**

Other acronyms:
- MM - Market Maker, an infinite buy/sell for certain materials on all CX (Commodity Exchanges)

#### Is there any way to trade wares privately?

Not currently. You can, however, with PRO list a LM (Local Market) buy ad for 0.01 currency. Do note that there are fees associated with listing ads.

#### How do I coordinate with my friend?

The simplest way is to organize favorable LM (Local Market) ads. For example:

- PlayerA exclusively produces H2O (water).
- PlayerB exclusively runs FPs (Food Processors) solely producing DW (Drinking Water).
- PlayerB purchases H2O from PlayerA and produces DW to sell on the CX.

#### How do I find how much money I have?

- The **FINLA** command
- Enable **SDBR** top-left to show your cash balances on the right side

#### Why can't I use the LM (Local Market), FX (Currency Exchange), or run for governor?

A [PRO](../pro-license) license is required.

#### Why does the game say I'm not allowed to vote for a candidate?

You need to be a resident of the planet for 48 hours before you can cast a vote.

#### Where can I find a corporation to join?

- Ask around in APEX chat, discord, or the forums
- Join [UFO Discord](https://discord.gg/vwcUJx8HHP) and follow the instructions to join the recruitment channels

#### I have a planet name. How can I find out where it is?

The **PLI** command by itself (without any arguments). Once done, you can type in the name of the planet.

#### What planet should I start on? What is a good starter package right now?

As with most things in this game, it depends. There is not a single correct answer. Many in the community are willing to share their opinions on the matter, however, so don't hesitate to ask in-game, on the official [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rRbqqRz), or on the [forums](https://com.prosperousuniverse.com).

#### What is "pirating"?

Pirating is when one player picks up a shipping ad and _intentionally_ does not hold up their end of the contract. This takes the following forms:

+ For buy/sell ads:
  - The company paying doesn't fulfill their end of the contract (paying)
  - The company putting forth material goods doesn't fulfill their end of the contract
+ For shipping ads:
  - The company requesting the shipping being done doesn't pay
  - The company doing the shipping fails to deliver, leading to the contents of the shipment being unpacked into their inventory

Failing to fulfill a contract negatively impacts your reliability rating in game.
