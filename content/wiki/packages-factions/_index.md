This page will help you find a suitable combination of package, faction and starting location when first establishing your company. Follow the advice below is especially vital if you are new to APEX. Once you have settled on a package, have a look at the different factions and the planets they control. Certain planets are better suited for some professions than others, and some planets and professions do not work together at all! But of course, the better suited a planet is for your industry, the higher the local competition will be.

## Packages

### Victualler
__Short description__  
FIXME Producing agricultural products that can be used in the food industries is the foundation of every colony.

__Long description__  
TODO

#### Important notes
As a victualler, you depend on water. If you do not settle on a planet with water, you will have a harder time turning a profit. The speed at which the crops on your farms will grow depends on a planet's soil fertility - the higher the fertility, the quicker the growth.

#### Starting Sections
__Rig (RIG):__ Extracts liquids (water) from the ground.  
__Farmstead (FRM):__ Requires water to output different integredients used in food production and adjacent industries.  
__Food Processor (FP):__ Takes food ingredients and turns them into consumables.

#### Recommended starting planets
CI1 (Castillo-Ito Mercantile)  
Promitor (Insitor Cooperative)


### Metallurgist
__Short description__  
FIXME Metallurgy experts have all the knowledge necessary to refine basic raw materials into precious metals and composites.

__Long description__  
TODO

#### Important notes
Extracting ores from the ground will be an essential everyday task for your company. Make sure that your planet contains at least one mineral, or you will not be able to put your Extractor to use.

#### Starting Sections
__Extractor (EXT) (2x):__ Extracts ores from a planet's surface.  
__Smelter (SME):__ Refines ores into metals.

#### Recommended starting planets
All available starting planets.


### Carbon Farmer
__Short description__  
FIXME This package provides you with experts in the field of resource extraction. They will speed up your ore and gas mining operations significantly.

__Long description__  
TODO Carbon has become a vital resource across different industries. 

#### Important notes
Setting up shop on a planet with higher fertility will help increase your farms' output. If a planet is completely infertile, farms cannot be built at all!

#### Starting Sections
__Farmstead (FRM) (2x):__ Requires water to output different integredients used in food production and adjacent industries.  
__Incinerator (INC):__ Extracts pure carbon from different carbon-rich plants.

#### Recommended starting planets
CI1 (Castillo-Ito Mercantile)
Promitor (Insitor Cooperative)


### Manufacturer
__Short description__  
FIXME The food industries play a vital role in processing agricultural goods into edibles and food supplements. Only a well-fed workforce is a happy workforce.

__Long description__  
TODO Your company's main purpose will be to produce polyethylene. 

#### Important notes
Your production lines will need carbon and hydrogen to operate. While hydrogen can be extracted from the atmosphere of certain planets directly, you will depend on other companies to sell you carbon, which is more likely to circulate on planets providing water and high fertility.

#### Starting Sections
__Collector (COL):__  Extracts gases from the atmosphere.  
__Incinerator (INC):__ Extracts carbon from plants.  
__Basic Materials Plant (BMP):__ Produces a host of materials and end products needed to bootstrap a colony.

#### Recommended starting planets
Vallis (NEO Charter Exploration)


### Constructor
__Short description__  
FIXME This package provides you with experts in possession of deep knowledge regarding everything from basic structural elements to complex engineering materials.

__Long description__  
TODO

#### Important notes
Even though you will not be mining iron oxide (FEO) yourself, make sure to settle down near or - better yet - on a planet containing FEO to make sure you will be able to buy it from other companies around you.

#### Starting Sections
__Basic Materials Plant (BMP):__ Produces a host of materials and end products needed to bootstrap a colony.  
__Prefab Plant Mk1 (PP1):__ Produces basic prefabs necessary to construct buildings.  

#### Recommended starting planets
Montem (NEO Charter Exploration)
Vallis (NEO Charter Exploration)
