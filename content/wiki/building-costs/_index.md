This page lists all the rules in place for building costs. If you would like to know how to set up buildings, have a look at the [Base setup](LINK) page. Construction more advanced Sections works the same as it did for your starting structures.

## General rules

The basic building costs of each building can be looked up in your base's BSC window (hit "CONSTRUCT" in your base overview):

However, these costs only paint a part of the picture. They pertain to this particular base, which is located on a concrete planet. Costs for erecting structures on other planets deviate based on the following set of rules.

* Temperature

<-25: InsuFoam
> 75: Thermal Shielding


Gravity:
< 0.25: Magnetic Floor
>  2.5: Breathable Liquid

Atmo. pressure:
< 0.25: Sealant
>  2.0: Hardened Structural Elements

Gaseous planets:
Aerostat Foundation

Fertility = 0
* Hydroponics Farm needs Metal Halide Lamp
* Farms & Orchards cannot be built

area cost = building size
also counts for planetary projects & corporate projects
