### Tutorials

# Overview

Welcome to the tutorials!  

We have prepared both written and video tutorials on the subjects listed on the left side of your screen. If you are new to APEX, make sure you read or watch tutorials 1 and 2 (2.1-2.4) to get you started. Tutorials 3-7 cover more advanced topics you will not need to understand right away when first using APEX. If you would like to look up specific information, please refer to the [wiki](../wiki).

Have fun and good luck!
