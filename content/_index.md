# APEX handbook

## Welcome, licensees!

The APEX Handbook is divided in two big sections:

The [tutorials](tutorials) are a collection of step-by-step guides on different procedures such as setting up your company, making use of your spacecraft, forming a Corporation, etc.

The [wiki](wiki) spans different categories of sub-pages including history, factions, celestial bodies, and more.

## Psst! New here?

All the information on these pages pertains to a sci-fi MMO called [Prosperous Universe](https://prosperousuniverse.com/) which is being developed by [simulogics](https://simulogics.net/). The handbook is written in-character about a software called APEX, through which the entire game is accessed. If you want to get started with the game, you have to get access first since it is currently in a closed beta state we are calling “First Acess”. You can enter First Access by either securing a key from an ongoing give-away or by [buying one from the store](LINK).

If you have access to the game, make sure you read or watch tutorials 1 and 2 (2.1-2.4) to get you started. Tutorials 3-7 cover more advanced topics you won't need to understand right away when first playing the game.

## Want to contribute?

Even though the Handbook's initial content has been added by APEX staff, it is possible for licensees to contribute their own information. All contributions will be fact-checked by APEX staff before release. (Please note: During First Access and Early Access, no information on concrete physical entities such as celestial bodies should be added due to potential layout changes to the Universe and System maps.)

Learn how to contribute [on this page](https://github.com/simulogics/prosperousuniverse-docs#contribute-by-editing-the-wiki-on-your-own-machine)!
